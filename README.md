# Magento 2 Extensions Ready List
### A CSV list of Magento extensions that are available or not for Magento 2

## Introduction
In November 2015, Magento 2 Stable was released and since then, the number of Magento 2 extensions has been rising slowly. The problem is that merchants and implementors depend on these Magento extensions to become "Magento 2 ready". Of course, there is the official resource of Magento to list which Magento 2 extensions are ready. But this does not give any news on which Magento 2 extensions are actually NOT ready, and possibly which extensions will never see Magento 2 compatibility.
- https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/magento-2
- https://marketplace.magento.com/extensions.html

This project aims to solve this problem: By listing extensions that are both Magento-2-ready and those which are not, merchants can see the state of Magento 2 changing, but also extension providers can learn for which of their extensions there is actually a demand, and for which there is not. This leads to some kind of voting mechanism - for which this project is the start ...

## Todo
- Find an easy way for people to submit new entries to this listing
- Find a way for people to rate the listing entries, so a more popular extension gets priority above a lesser popular extension
